 I worked on the occular disease detection challange from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k?resource=download
 The Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset contains 5,000 patient records, each consisting of:

    1. Left and right eye fundus photographs (captured using various cameras, including Canon, Zeiss, and Kowa)
    2. Patient age
    3. patient gender
The Problem essentially breaks down to a fairly easy and straight forward multi-class classification challange, with the classes being:
    1. Normal (N) – No observed abnormalities
    2. Diabetes (D) – Signs of diabetic retinopathy
    3. Glaucoma (G) – Indications of glaucoma
    4. Cataract (C) – Presence of cataracts
    5. Age-related Macular Degeneration (A) – AMD-related retinal changes
    6. Hypertension (H) – Hypertensive retinopathy
    7. Pathological Myopia (M) – High myopia with retinal complications
    8. Other diseases/abnormalities (O) – Additional ocular conditions
